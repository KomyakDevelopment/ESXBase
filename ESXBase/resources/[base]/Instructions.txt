This is not required for the server to work but i recommend it for you who are new to creating FiveM servers.
Put all your resources inside this file [base] and don't touch the [core] file if you are not absolutely sure
that you can manage to without ruining your files. I recommend doing backups regularly.

Altough this is not recommended for new FiveM Developers i will still list some guides below.
